# Quantitative Research Analysis – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Forage Virtual Internship)

## Overview

This task was completed as part of the **JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/), held in **May 2025**. The internship simulation focused on applying quantitative methods to financial data, modeling risk, and designing scalable tools for client-facing applications.

The primary objective was to develop data-driven models for estimating default probabilities, pricing, and natural gas forecasts based on real-world financial datasets.


## Work Highlights

1. **Probability of Default Modeling**
   
     • Analyzed a synthetic loan book to estimate the probability of default for each customer

     • Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms to predict defaults effectively
  
     • Compared model performance and selected the best fit using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
  

2. **FICO Score Quantization**
   
     • Converted raw FICO scores into optimized categorical bins using dynamic programming

     • Implemented a quantization-based credit rating model that improved risk stratification
  

3. **Natural Gas Price Forecasting**
   
     • Built a time series forecasting model to extrapolate natural gas prices from historical monthly data

     • Applied moving average smoothing and ARIMA techniques for trend estimation
  

4. **Prototype Pricing Model**
   
    • Designed a dynamic pricing prototype to automate client quotes

    • Structured the model with scalable validation-ready logic for production deployment
  


## Tools & Technologies Used

  • Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels)

  • Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations

  • Time Series Analysis (ARIMA, smoothing)

  • Jupyter Notebook
